## Socket.io

> Socket.IO is a cross-browser JavaScript library that provides bidirectional, event-driven communication capabilities for use in realtime applications. It consists of a client-side browser library and a server-side Node.js library, both of which use similar syntax to enable an easily scriptable interface for developers.

> Exposed as the io namespace in the standalone build, or the result of calling require('socket.io-client').

```javascript
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  const socket = io('http://localhost');
</script>
```

```javascript
const io = require('socket.io-client');
// or with import syntax
import io from 'socket.io-client';
```
