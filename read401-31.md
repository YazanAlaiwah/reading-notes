## Hooks API

> its lets you use state and other features in React without writing a class.

#### When would I use a Hook?

> If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component. Weâ€™re going to do that right now!

#### How to use it

> in class we was write this.state.name = 'example' to set state in functional we will use useState like const [name,setName] = useState('example') the name is the variable that hold the value and teh setName is like this.setState to make new value for it and we call like {name} instead of this.state.name

### Effect Hook

> It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount it will serve after every render include the first render
