## Asynchronous Actions

> When you call an asynchronous API, there are two crucial moments in time: the moment you start the call, and the moment when you receive an answer (or a timeout).

> Each of these two moments usually require a change in the application state; to do that, you need to dispatch normal actions that will be processed by reducers synchronously. Usually, for any API request you'll want to dispatch at least three different kinds of actions:

1. An action informing the reducers that the request began.
2. An action informing the reducers that the request finished successfully.
3. An action informing the reducers that the request failed.
