## OAuth

> OAuth is a standard that apps can use to provide client applications with “secure delegated access”. OAuth works over HTTPS and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.

> There are two versions of OAuth: OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0. These specifications are completely different from one another, and cannot be used together: there is no backwards compatibility between them.
