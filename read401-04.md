4. *What is Mongoose and why do we need it?*
its an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. and its used to manages relationships between data, provides schema validation

5. *Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally*
have the ability to become larger and much more powerful, making them the preferred choice for large or constantly evolving data sets.
