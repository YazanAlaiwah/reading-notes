## Component Composition

### props.children

> its the data between the component opening and closing tags
> Example

```javascript
<Picture key={picture.id} src={picture.src}>
  //what is placed here is passed as props.children
</Picture>
```

> it could be anything even other component

### Composition

> react components are just object so we can pass it in side props
> Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.

### Hooks

> They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
