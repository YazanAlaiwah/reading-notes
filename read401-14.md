## RBAC
> Role-based access control restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that users have to the network.


## RBAC implementation 
1. *Inventory your systems* -> know what u need in your information for which you need to control access
2. *Analyze your workforce and create roles* -> make your clients in groups (roles) with there access
3. *Assign people to roles* -> make for every role the users will be on it
4. *Never make one-off changes* -> do not make any changes of the roles or users access to not have bugs in the access
5. *Audit* -> review the roles for the users Periodically to know if you need to change something in the access for some roles
