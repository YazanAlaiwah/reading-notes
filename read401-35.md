## Graphs

> A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### Directed vs Undirected

##### Undirected

> is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

##### Directed

> where every edge is directed.

### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

Complete >> A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

Connected >> is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

Disconnected >> is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

### Acyclic vs Cyclic

Acyclic Graph >> An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

Cyclic Graphs >> A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.
