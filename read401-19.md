## Socket.io

> Socket.IO allows you to “namespace” your sockets, which essentially means assigning different endpoints or paths. This is a useful feature to minimize the number of resources (TCP connections) and at the same time separate concerns within your application by introducing separation between communication channels.

## messaging queue

> A message queue is a queue of messages sent between applications. It includes a sequence of work objects that are waiting to be processed. ... Another application, called a consumer, connects to the queue and gets the messages to be processed. Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the consumer retrieves them.
