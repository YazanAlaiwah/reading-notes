#### error handling and debugging

when we write javascript code we do not expect to do it perfictly from the first time and we have an errors.

##### ways to debugging the errors

1. the console and dev tools -> Tools built into the browser that help you hunt for errors.
2. common problems -> find the most errors that peapole make and see how they solve it.
3. handiling errors -> How code can deal with potential errors gracefully. 

###### ORDER OF EXECUTION 

some time you should checke from the order of you scripts becuse some scripts need another script to work before it works

##### UNDERSTANDING ERRORS 

If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an **exception**.
At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handl ing code.
