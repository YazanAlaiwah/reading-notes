## Bearer 

> Bearer Tokens are the predominant type of access token


## JWT
>A JSON Web Token is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. 

## What Is the JSON Web Token Structure?

1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

*Header*
The header typically consists of two parts: the type of token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm that is used, such 

For example:
```javascript
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

*Payload*
The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity.

An example payload is shown below:
```javascript
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```


*Signature*
To create the signature part, you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

Then, you have to put it all together. 



## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
1. Authorization
2. Information Exchange
