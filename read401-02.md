### TDD

its stand for _Test-driven development_ and its process that make sure your project work as expected whlie we start by make some test of our project then start to code and bass these tests and this process will make that you dont have any conflict in the code when you write some that will make reflect in outher part

### functional programming

### Continuous Integration (CI)

is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.

### unit testing
its a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested.
> A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. In procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure,
