## Transforms

#### Transform Syntax

The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

```css
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
  -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
  -o-transform: scale(1.5);
  transform: scale(1.5);
}
```
#### 2D Transforms

###### 2D Rotate
The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. 

###### 2D Scale
Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

##### 2D Translate
The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
