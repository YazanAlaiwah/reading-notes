## Props and State

#### props

> props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React

#### state

> State is like a data store to the ReactJS component. It is mostly used to update the component when user performed some action like clicking button, typing some text, pressing some key

#### setState

> its the only way to update the state in react it will update the state and tell to react to render the changes in the changed nodes in the DOM _change the state will not make react render it_

#### Handling Events

> you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly.

#### Components and Props

> components help us to organize the UI to have every block of code in one component to help us style and debug.
> there is 2 way to write component _function_ and _class_
> the tags in react are the same in html tags but also it can be the name of other component

#### State and Lifecycle

> react have lifecycle methods that call in many situations represented the life of react component tell its end

###### lifecycle methods

1. _componentDidMount_ -> runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.
2. _componentWillUnmount_ -> is the last function to be called immediately before the component is removed from the DOM.
