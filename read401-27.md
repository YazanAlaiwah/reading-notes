## React Testing and Deployment

> react use _jest_ for testing to run the test type `npm test`

> to test type _it()_ || _test()_ with the name of the test and you can wrap ie with _descripe()_ for collection of some moduel You can also use jest.fn() and expect(fn).toBeCalled() to create “spies” or mock functions.

### Snapshot

> Snapshot testing is a feature of Jest that allows you to test Javascript objects. They work well with React components because when you render a component you can view the DOM output and create a “snapshot” at the time of the test run.

### Static Rendering API

> Use enzyme's render function to generate HTML from your React tree, and analyze the resulting HTML structure.

### Shallow Testing

> Executes and renders the called/container component, but does not compose children.

### Mounting

> Executes the full component and children. Allows for inspection of rendered Virtual DOM as well as the current state
