## Combined Reducers

> The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

### Arguments

1. reducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.

### Returns

(Function): A reducer that invokes every reducer inside the reducers object, and constructs a state object with the same shape.
