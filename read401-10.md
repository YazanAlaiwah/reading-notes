## Stack

tha stack is a data structure that work on one way its references to the next node and its have to concepts:
1. *FILO* -> First In Last Out 
2. *LIFO* -> Last In First Out

thats mean that the most new value add to the stack will be the first value remove 

## Queue

A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle. In the queue only two operations are allowed enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item. The picture demonstrates the FIFO access.

>The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
